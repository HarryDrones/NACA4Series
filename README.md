Processing code for generating NACA 4 digit airfoils
The program uses two sliders to adjust camber and thickness.  The highpoint is fixed at 40% chord for now.  The NACA4Series.png file is a screenshot of how the sliders work.  At first, all sliders are set to zero and all you get is a flat line.
If the only adjustment is to the vertical slider, then all you get is a camber line.  If the only adjustment is to the horizontal slider, then you will get a symmetrical NACA foil with no camber of course.  If you adjust both sliders, then you will get a NACA foil with camber and thickness.  There is some limit to what this program will properly display.  It seems ok under 15% camber and 15% thickness.  Above that, and it starts to break down visually.  This is a limitation of the author and not the NACA algorithm.
